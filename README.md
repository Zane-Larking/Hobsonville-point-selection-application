# Hobsonville-point-selection-application

Choosing classes at Hobsonville Point Secondary School is not simple and you always seem to end up without a class that you need.

Our schools current class selection process is a little too complicated, and is facilitated over many various documents and sites. We are hoping to improve this process, make it less daunting and integrate all parts of the process.

This project will impact the school for the better by helping to make class selections much more streamlined and provide more powerful, simpler tools.

We are planning to create and implement a interactive class selection web application, that will help students to select the best possible classes for themselves and make it easier to see what classes they need to take. 
Additionally students will be able to submit their choices, with an application if applicable, to be verified by their hub coaches. If the hub coach approves their students selection theyâ€™d be able to submit the choices to the selection management.
